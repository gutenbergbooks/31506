<p>(<i>Sitting-room of the DeSmythe home; "confusion
worse confounded;" everything topsy-turvy</i>.
<span class='sc'>Mrs. DeSmythe</span> <i>on couch;</i> <span class='sc'>Madam
Sateene</span> <i>and she looking over lace samples, of
which they have a great number. Madam in
"swell" street costume</i>.)</p>
</div> <!-- block quote -->

<p><span class='player'>Mrs. De S.</span>  (<i>tossing samples in a heap</i>). There's positively
<i>nothing</i> like it! Nothing anywhere near it!</p>

<p><span class='player'>Madam</span>  No, and nothing that can be used.</p>

<p><span class='player'>Mrs. De S.</span>  (<i>snatching a bit of lace from the heap</i>).
There! That's a lover's knot pattern. Why, it&#8211;</p>

<p><span class='player'>Madam</span>  No, that's a sailor's knot. There is a great
difference.</p>

<p><span class='player'>Mrs. De S.</span>  (<i>vaguely</i>). I don't see it.</p>

<p><span class='player'>Madam</span>  (<i>patiently</i>). You see the loop in this bends
down and in this, it bends&#8211;goes up. Every difference
in the world, my dear Mrs. De Smythe.</p>

<p><span class='player'>Mrs. De S.</span>  (<i>meekly, but convinced</i>). Wouldn't it
do? All bunched up?</p>

<p><span class='player'>Madam</span>  But it is not to be bunched up!</p>

<p><span class='player'>Mrs. De S.</span>  (<i>with a profound sigh</i>). What <i>can</i> we
do? And I threatened with an attack!</p>

<p><span class='player'>Madam</span>  I don't know! (<i>rises, sits down, then
groans</i>). I am at my wit's end. Let me think.</p>

<p><span class='player'>Mrs. De S.</span>  (<i>with an inspiration</i>). Take the lace off!</p>

<p><span class='player'>Madam</span>  (<i>crushingly</i>). My dear Mrs. De Smythe,
the gown is <i>modelled</i> for lace.</p>

<p><span class='player'>Mrs. De S.</span>  (<i>helplessly</i>). Oh!</p>

<p>(<i>Madam sits in brown study, tapping her forehead</i>.)</p>

<p><span class='player'>Madam</span>  Let me see; Wednesday morning. (<i>looks
at watch</i>). Ten o'clock. It might be done. Practically
two days. (<i>sits staring at wall</i>). No, it couldn't! We
might use chiffon.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_6'></a>6</span><span class='player'>Mrs. De S.</span>  Maude hates chiffon.</p>

<p><span class='player'>Madam</span>  (<i>with professional coldness</i>). Chiffon is a
very artistic trimming.</p>

<p><span class='player'>Mrs. De S.</span>  (<i>wearily</i>). It may be&#8211;it may be, but
you know Maude.</p>

<p>(<i>Enter</i> <span class='sc'>Miss Hoppenhoer</span>.)</p>

<p><span class='player'>Miss H.</span>  (<i>looks around; sniffs at the untidiness</i>).
Jennie, you look ready to faint!</p>

<p><span class='player'>Mrs. De S.</span>  Sit down. Don't stand there like&#8211;a&#8211;wooden
Indian!</p>

<p><span class='player'>Miss H.</span>  They don't keel over every few minutes,
anyhow! (<i>sits with a thud</i>). You look ready to faint!</p>

<p><span class='player'>Mrs. De S.</span>  I feel ready to faint; the lace has given
out.</p>

<p><span class='player'>Miss H.</span>  (<i>picking up things)</i>. The lace&#8211;?</p>

<p><span class='player'>Mrs. De S.</span>  (<i>with infinite patience</i>). The lace, you
know, for Maude's dress.</p>

<p><span class='player'>Miss H.</span>  (<i>blankly</i>). Eh&#8211;what dress?</p>

<p><span class='player'>Madam</span>  (<i>in polite surprise</i>). Why, Miss Hoppenhoer,
<i>what</i> dress?</p>

<p><span class='player'>Mrs. De S.</span>  (<i>shrilly</i>). <i>What</i> dress,&#8211;oh, Matilda!</p>

<p><span class='player'>Miss H.</span>  (<i>commencing to "straighten" room in earnest</i>).
Oh, is <i>that</i> all? I thought the President had been
assassinated!</p>

<p><span class='player'>Mrs. De S.</span>  Matilda! I must say you don't seem
much interested. I should think you would,&#8211;your own
niece, too!</p>

<p><span class='player'>Miss H.</span>  (<i>tragically</i>). Look at this room,&#8211;<i>look at
this room!</i> It is a disgrace to a Christian community!
Think of the breakfast we had&#8211;or rather, that we didn't
have! And yesterday! And now you down sick&#8211;<i>down
sick!</i> Does it take a month to graduate? (<i>dusts an upholstered
chair vigorously</i>). It's such (<i>bang</i>) such non-(<i>bang</i>) nonsense!</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_7'></a>7</span><span class='player'>Mrs. De S.</span>  Nonsense to graduate! Matilda Hoppenhoer!
Do stop thrashing about! Ugh, that dust!
(<i>coughs weakly</i>). Katherine will do that.</p>

<p><span class='player'>Miss H.</span>  (<i>pounding sofa cushions</i>). Katherine is
busy; she has ten miles of flutin' to flute!</p>

<p><span class='player'>Mrs. De S.</span>  (<i>coughing</i>). Well, stop, anyway! My
nerves are bad today.</p>

<p><span class='player'>Miss H.</span>  You are worn out. We're all as cross as
bears!</p>

<p><span class='player'>Madam</span>  (<i>emerging from a brown study</i>). What
shall I do? And only a yard needed! I think chiffon&#8211;</p>

<p><span class='player'>Miss H.</span>  (<i>straightening out a rug</i>). Use ribbon.</p>

<p><span class='player'>Madam</span>  (<i>with dignity</i>). They used ribbon last year.</p>

<p><span class='player'>Miss H.</span>  Fringe, then,&#8211;fringe is very dressy.</p>

<p><span class='player'>Madam</span>  They used fringe two years ago.</p>

<p><span class='player'>Miss H.</span>  (<i>snapping her up</i>). Well, what's the idea?
To use something that hasn't never been used?</p>

<p>(<span class='sc'>Maude</span> <i>comes in, breathless.</i>)</p>

<p><span class='player'>Maude</span>  (<i>sitting down hard</i>). Goodness, I'm tired!
Auntie, your grammar is bad&#8211;very bad. What are you
doing?</p>

<p><span class='player'>Miss H.</span>  (<i>sarcastically</i>). Getting you ready to graduate.</p>

<p><span class='player'>Maude</span>  (<i>peeling off her gloves</i>). Well sir, I've just
been racing around! O, Valeria's going to have chiffon.</p>

<p><span class='player'>Madam</span>  (<i>dramatically</i>). Chiffon!</p>

<p><span class='player'>Maude</span>  (<i>tossing her hat on the floor</i>). Yes, and it's
awfully pretty.</p>

<p><span class='player'>Madam</span>  Chiffon! Is she? (<i>Sits, from sheer weakness.</i>)</p>

<p><span class='player'>Maude</span>  (<i>beginning to undo sundry packages</i>). Yes,
and&#8211;why, what's the matter?</p>

<p><span class='player'>Madam</span>  (<i>gasping</i>). Chiffon!</p>

<p><span class='player'>Maude</span>  (<i>a light dawning</i>). Am I? Am I?</p>

<p><span class='player'>Miss H.</span>  (<i>winding yarn into a ball</i>). Am you what?
Sit down, child, sit down, you look like a statute!</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_8'></a>8</span><span class='player'>Maude</span>  Am I to have chiffon?</p>

<p><span class='player'>Mrs. De S.</span>  (<i>firmly</i>). You are.</p>

<p><span class='player'>Maude</span>  We can't both have chiffon! I won't be
a copy-tale! I won't!</p>

<p><span class='player'>Mrs. De S.</span>  (<i>sitting erect and speaking with authority</i>).
Listen, dearie. The lace has given out.</p>

<p><span class='player'>Maude</span>  (<i>stamping her foot</i>). Get more!</p>

<p><span class='player'>Mrs. De S.</span>  We can't.</p>

<p><span class='player'>Madam</span>  And the gown is so modelled that we can
use nothing else.</p>

<p><span class='player'>Maude</span>  I won't have chiffon! I won't&#8211;<i>I won't</i>&#8211;<i>I
won't.</i></p>

<p><span class='player'>Mrs. De S.</span>  (<i>warningly</i>). Do not let Madame Sateene
see you in a passion.</p>

<p><span class='player'>Maude</span>  Madam would be in a passion herself! She
knows how I feel! O dear! (<i>begins to sob</i>). Everything
is going wrong! I w-w-won't graduate, so there
now!</p>

<p><span class='player'>Miss H.</span>  (<i>mounting a chair to straighten a picture</i>).
That's sensible! You needn't. I never did.</p>

<p><span class='player'>Mrs. De S.</span>  Matilda, do not encourage the child! Of
course she must graduate. Everybody does.</p>

<p><span class='player'>Miss H.</span>  (<i>sarcastically</i>). If everybody stood on their
heads, I suppose we'd have to!</p>

<p><span class='player'>Mrs. De S.</span>  You cannot judge in such matters, Matilda.
You are very old-fashioned.</p>

<p><span class='player'>Miss H.</span>  (<i>upsetting contents of work basket in lap</i>).
Maybe so, maybe so, but I am alive, and that child'll be
dead if&#8211;</p>

<p><span class='player'>Mrs. De S.</span>  (<i>holds her head</i>). Matilda, for heaven's
sake, stop!</p>

<p><span class='player'>Maude</span>  I'll telephone Valeria. May be she&#8211;</p>

<p><span class='player'>Mrs. De S.</span>  (<i>with decision</i>). Maude, sit down! You
will do nothing of the sort. Mrs. Reynolds is <i>such</i> a
talker! The whole town would know it in ten minutes.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_9'></a>9</span>
Besides, at the Tuesday Club she cut me&#8211;actually <i>cut</i>
me! I will not permit it.</p>

<p><span class='player'>Maude</span>  I don't think that ought to count, <i>now</i>. I
suppose I have to have something to wear.</p>

<p><span class='player'>Madam</span>  What do you say to a Paris muslin?</p>

<p><span class='player'>Maude</span>  (<i>listlessly</i>). What is a Paris muslin?</p>

<p><span class='player'>Madam</span>  A sort of fine organdie.</p>

<p><span class='player'>Maude</span>  Swell?</p>

<p><span class='player'>Mrs. De S.</span>  Maudie! Would Madam Sateene propose
anything else? She doesn't want you to look like
a fright. Now, I think,&#8211;(<i>pauses, listening</i>). Why
there is papa's voice!</p>

<p><span class='player'>Maude</span>  Papa, bless his old bones! Papa, come in
here, quick! Hurry up!</p>

<p>(<span class='sc'>Mr. De Smythe</span> <i>comes in hastily</i>.)</p>

<p><span class='player'>Mr. De S.</span>  What is it&#8211;what is it? Is Mamma worse?</p>

<p><span class='player'>Maude</span>  (<i>in tragic attitude</i>). I can't graduate!</p>

<p><span class='player'>Mr. De S.</span>  (<i>with profound astonishment</i>). Can't
graduate? Can't graduate? Didn't you pass?</p>

<p><span class='player'>Maude</span>  (<i>scornfully</i>). Pass! That doesn't matter!
My dress, my dress, my dress!</p>

<p><span class='player'>Mr. De S.</span>  (<i>immensely relieved</i>). Oh, your dress!
Isn't it fine enough?</p>

<p><span class='player'>Madam</span>  Why, you see, Mr. De Smythe, the&#8211;</p>

<p><span class='player'>Maude</span>  (<i>sobbing and clinging to his neck</i>). I got
to have chiffon, ugly, limp, old chiffon! It is so&#8211;so&#8211;d&#8211;drabbled!</p>

<p><span class='player'>Mr. De S.</span>  Well, never mind! Hus-s-h! You'll make
Mamma worse. You needn't graduate! Never mind.</p>

<p><span class='player'>Maude</span>  Oh, oh!</p>

<p><span class='player'>Mr. De S.</span>  Never mind, little girl, you needn't graduate!
Never mind!</p>

<p><span class='player'>Maude</span>  Oh, I&#8211;I must. The presents are coming
in.</p>

<p><span class='player'>Miss H.</span>  (<i>shortly</i>). Return 'em.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_10'></a>10</span><span class='player'>Maude</span>  You wouldn't, if they were yours! You
know you wouldn't! Oh, you're all so mean!</p>

<p><span class='player'>Madam</span>  (<i>soothingly</i>). Let's have Paris muslin. It'll
be lovely.</p>

<p><span class='player'>Mrs. De S.</span>  It's too stiff.</p>

<p><span class='player'>Miss H.</span>  And sounds too furrin! Haven't we got any
American muslin? I'd rather wear gunny sack.</p>

<p><span class='player'>Mr. De S.</span>  Hurrah for Matilda! A female Patrick
Henry!</p>

<p><span class='player'>Mrs. De S.</span>  Papa, don't speak so loud!</p>

<p><span class='player'>Mr. De S.</span>  (<i>contritely</i>). I beg your pardon, Mamma,&#8211;your
poor head!</p>

<p><span class='player'>Maude</span>  I want something pretty! Not&#8211;not just&#8211;just
any old thing!</p>

<p><span class='player'>Madam</span>  (<i>with awful dignity</i>). Paris muslin is beautiful.</p>

<p><span class='player'>Maude</span>  The other girls have silk.</p>

<p><span class='player'>Mr. De S.</span>  Then you must have silk, too,&#8211;decidedly.
Mustn't she, Mamma?</p>

<p><span class='player'>Mrs. De S.</span>  (<i>sighing</i>). I do not know, Papa, I do
not know. This is a dreadful time,&#8211;a dreadful time.
I fear I shall not live to see her graduate! (<i>sighs dismally</i>).
But you will all enjoy it. Matilda, will you heat
the salt bags?</p>

<p>(<span class='sc'>Miss Hoppenhoer</span> <i>bounces out</i>.)</p>

<p><span class='player'>Maude</span>  (<i>flies to couch</i>). O, you precious, precious
Mamma! Don't you dare get sick and die!</p>

<p>(<span class='sc'>Katherine</span> <i>opens the door</i>.)</p>

<p><span class='player'>Katherine</span>  Miss Reynolds and Mr. Hamilton.</p>

<p><span class='player'>Maude</span>  Hello, Valeria, how you vas? Jack, did you
get 'em?</p>

<p><span class='player'>Jack</span>  (<i>bows to ladies, shakes hands with Mr. De
Smythe</i>). Couldn't Maude, nothing but red.</p>

<p><span class='player'>Maude</span>  <i>Red!</i> I can't wear red! Madam Sateene,
can I?</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_11'></a>11</span><span class='player'>Madam</span>  (<i>after due deliberation</i>). Yes, you can. You
will need a touch of color.</p>

<p><span class='player'>Valeria</span> Why don't you carry pink ones?</p>

<p><span class='player'>Jack</span>  Pink roses are lovely. You carried pink ones
at the Junior Banquet, didn't you, Val?</p>

<p><span class='player'>Valeria</span> (<i>thoughtfully</i>). Did I? Yes, I did! Bridesmaid,
I think they were.</p>

<p><span class='player'>Maude</span>  I hate pink roses!</p>

<p><span class='player'>Mrs. De S.</span>  Maudie, Maudie, do not be so vehement!</p>

<p><span class='player'>Mr. De S.</span>  Never mind about the roses. They are a
side issue. The question is, "Wherewithal shall you be
clothed!" I must be off to earn your daily cake. Let's
decide.</p>

<p><span class='player'>Maude</span>  (<i>pensively</i>). Jack, do you like Paris muslin?</p>

<p><span class='player'>Jack</span>  Is it anything like Plaster of Paris?</p>

<p><span class='player'>Maude</span>  Jack, behave! I am so worried! (<i>signs of
tears.</i>)</p>

<p><span class='player'>Valeria</span> She's just tired, poor dear; don't tease her,
Jack.</p>

<p><span class='player'>Maude</span>  (<i>with dignity</i>). I am <i>not</i> tired. He can't
tease me, thank you, Valeria. I think, Madam, I will
have Paris muslin. Silk is so common.</p>

<p><span class='player'>Jack</span>  Why don't you have bobinet?</p>

<p><span class='player'>Valeria</span> Why, Jack, bobinet is&#8211;</p>

<p><span class='player'>Jack</span>  I know what bobinet is; heavy and kind of
corded,&#8211;dead swell.</p>

<p><span class='player'>Maude</span>  That's pique!</p>

<p><span class='player'>Mr. De S.</span>  Well, children, defer that discussion until
the Fourth of July. Is there time for a whole new rig?</p>

<p><span class='player'>Madam</span>  Y-e-s,&#8211;I think so.</p>

<p><span class='player'>Mr. De S.</span>  Cheer up, everybody! We'll have the
prettiest frock in the outfit, if it breaks the R.I.P. Railroad!
We are the people! I must go hunt those papers&#8211;things

Madam Sateene will save us! (<i>goes</i>).</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_12'></a>12</span><span class='player'>Madam</span>  (<i>rising with alacrity</i>). I shall go look at
Paris muslins. Shall I bring you samples?</p>

<p><span class='player'>Mrs. De S.</span>  No, I am not able to decide. We trust
to you absolutely, Madam Sateene, absolutely. (<i>groans</i>).
I believe I am going to have an attack! Oh, dear, my
nerves! They actually twitch! I wish Matilda were of
some use in such matters. Because she never graduated,
she thinks Maude shouldn't! Jack, do you see my
smelling salts?</p>

<p>(<span class='sc'>Jack</span> <i>hunts for the salts. Girls talk apart.</i> <span class='sc'>Madam</span>

<p><span class='player'>Madam</span>  Miss Maude, how would you like ribbon,
very narrow satin ribbon?</p>

<p><span class='player'>Maude</span>  Kate Saunders had that in&#8211;let me see,&#8211;oh,
in 1900.</p>

<p><span class='player'>Valeria</span> And that French Girl,&#8211;Giggre&#8211;wore it last
year.</p>

<p><span class='player'>Madam</span>  O dear! (<i>grimly</i>). Anybody ever use rope?</p>

<p><span class='player'>Jack</span>  (<i>grinning</i>). Only men&#8211;for neck-ties mostly.
I can't find it, Mrs. De Smythe.</p>

<p><span class='player'>Mrs. De S.</span>  Then Matilda has put it in the medicine
chest. She is so neat! I can't help it&#8211;I don't
want to have an attack! What shall I do? But I am
afraid I&#8211;I am going to have one!</p>

<p><span class='player'>Maude</span>  (<i>with signs of tears</i>). O, Mamma, don't
have an attack! What shall I do? No roses, no dress,
no nothing!</p>

<p><span class='player'>Madam</span>  (<i>resolutely</i>). Well, you shall have a dress,
about noon, to give you (<i>with a tragic sweep of hand</i>)
if it is my last effort! Mrs. De Smythe, I'll drop in
and report! (<i>Goes hastily.</i>)</p>

<p><span class='player'>Valeria</span> I must go. I stopped for a list of my committee.</p>

<p><span class='player'>Maude</span>  (<i>absently</i>). Don't go. What committee?</p>

<p><span class='player'>Valeria</span> Committee on Decorations.</p>

<p><span class='player'>Maude</span>  (<i>vaguely</i>). Committee on&#8211;?</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_13'></a>13</span><span class='player'>Valeria</span> Decorations. Wake up!</p>

<p><span class='player'>Maude</span>  (<i>goes to desk</i>). O yes! (<i>rummages</i>). This
desk is disgraceful! Here it is! (<i>Reads crumpled paper.</i>)
"Be it resolved&#8211;" goodness, that's about poor
Ned Woodruff! Jack, who was on that committee?</p>

<p><span class='player'>Jack</span>  (<i>smoothing Valeria's gloves on his knee</i>). Miss
Secretary, I do not keep the minutes.</p>

<p><span class='player'>Maude</span>  Well, you were presiding! (<i>rummaging</i>).
Here it is,&#8211;six,&#8211;is that enough? Five, rather,&#8211;Hal
Taylor won't serve.</p>

<p><span class='player'>Valeria</span> (<i>taking the list</i>). O yes, he will.</p>

<p><span class='player'>Maude</span>  Said he wouldn't! Told Mabel Hopeland so

<p><span class='player'>Valeria</span> (<i>calmly</i>). Yes, he will.</p>

<p><span class='player'>Maude</span>  Well, he said he wouldn't.</p>

<p><span class='player'>Valeria</span> (<i>pocketing the list, unmoved</i>). He will if
I ask him.</p>

<p><span class='player'>Maude</span>  (<i>shutting desk with a bang</i>). Oh!</p>

<p>(<i>Enter</i> <span class='sc'>Miss Hoppenhoer</span>, <i>with shawls, salt bags, etc.</i>)</p>

<p><span class='player'>Miss H.</span>  Jennie, you'd better go to bed.</p>

<p><span class='player'>Mrs. De S.</span>  (<i>sadly</i>). I will. I hope I shall not have
an attack.</p>

<p><span class='player'>Miss H.</span>  Attack! We'll all have an attack before Friday
night! (<i>She busies herself about the couch. Valeria
and Maude go out.</i>)</p>

<p><span class='player'>Miss H.</span> Now, can you walk, do you think? I'd better

that bag&#8211;it's hot&#8211;awful hot! Lean on me&#8211;(<i>they go
out, but Miss Hoppenhoer runs back to pick up things</i>).</p>

<p><span class='player'>Jack</span>  Can't I help you! A fellow never knows what

<p>(<span class='sc'>Maude</span> <i>returns</i>.)</p>

<p><span class='player'>Jack</span>  Come on, Maude, I've got an old tandem out
there. Let's take a spin.</p>

In my day when girls got through school they quit, they

<p><span class='player'>Jack</span>  (<i>with infinite patience</i>). You know what I
mean, (<i>with terrible calmness</i>). Who gave you those?</p>

<p><span class='player'>Maude</span>  (<i>preparing to cry</i>). You're awfully cross, I
think.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_31'></a>31</span>(<span class='sc'>Mr. Bulbus</span> <i>enters in rear hunting something.</i> <span class='sc'>Maude</span>

<p><span class='player'>Jack</span>  (<i>unmoved</i>). Who gave you those?</p>

<p><span class='player'>Maude</span>  (<i>graciously, sweetly</i>). Mr. Bulbus, the lilies
are lovely.</p>

<p><span class='player'>Mr. B.</span>  (<i>surprised into dropping a hammer</i>). Yes'sum,
I'm glad you&#8211;you like 'em. (<i>retreats in confusion.</i>)</p>

<p><span class='player'>Jack</span>  Oh! (<i>slowly</i>). That's awfully nice of you.</p>

<p>(<i>Enter</i> <span class='sc'>Mrs. De Smythe</span> and <span class='sc'>Miss Hoppenhoer</span>,

<p><span class='player'>Mrs. De S.</span>  Where <i>is</i> your father? It's time to go.</p>

<p><span class='player'>Jack</span>  Past time. Grindem said to be there at 9:30.</p>

<p><span class='player'>Mrs. De S.</span>  What shall we do? I knew he would be
late! I hope I shall not have an attack!</p>

<p><span class='player'>Miss H.</span>  (<i>grimly</i>). No, I <i>hope</i> not&#8211;in that dress!</p>

<p><span class='player'>Mrs. De S.</span>  As if one's dress made any difference with
an attack! O, there he is! Well, Papa, you&#8211;good morning, Madam.</p>

<p>(<span class='sc'>Mr. De Smythe</span> <i>and</i> <span class='sc'>Madam Sateene</span> <i>come in together.</i>)</p>

<p><span class='player'>Mr. De S.</span>  My, how fine we look!</p>

<p><span class='player'>Maude</span>  Madam Sateene, this shoulder&#8211;wrinkles.</p>

<p><span class='player'>Madam</span>  Let me see. (<i>Madam and Maude consult
apart.</i>)</p>

<p><span class='player'>Mrs. De S.</span>  We ought to go.</p>

<p><span class='player'>Mr. De S.</span>  Miss Rantum hasn't come.</p>

<p><span class='player'>Jack</span>  (<i>looking up from his own Ms.</i>) O, I forgot!
Miss Baked Beans will meet us there. She couldn't
come here.</p>

<p><span class='player'>Maude</span>  She promised she would!</p>

<p><span class='player'>Mr. De S.</span>  All ready. How many of these do we
take? (<i>indicating flowers</i>). Need a dray?</p>

<p><span class='player'>Maude</span>  Only Jack's&#8211;and I carry them. Jack, you
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_32'></a>32</span>
carry my essay and fan. (<i>puts on hat</i>). Is it straight?
Where are my roses?</p>

<p>(<span class='sc'>Miss Hoppenhoer</span> <i>gives</i> <span class='sc'>Mr. De Smythe</span> <i>two shawls
and he goes.</i>)</p>

<p><span class='player'>Madam</span>  (<i>anxiously</i>). Wait one moment. (<i>adjusts
Maude's train</i>). Now.</p>

<p><span class='player'>Miss H.</span>  Have you any lemon drops?</p>

<p><span class='player'>Maude</span>  Of course not,&#8211;nobody carries lemon drops!
Where <i>is</i> my handkerchief!</p>

<p><span class='player'>Jack</span>  (<i>sheepishly, taking it out of his vest</i>). Here
it is.</p>

<p><span class='player'>Mr. De S.</span>  (<i>from door</i>). Come on, you people.</p>

<p><span class='player'>Mrs. De S.</span>  O dear, dear, I shall never stand it.</p>

<p><span class='player'>Miss H.</span>  (<i>collecting salts and fans</i>). We're coming.</p>

<p><span class='player'>Mrs. De S.</span>  O dear,&#8211;kiss me, Maudie. (<i>sits down
exhausted</i>). It's just like a wedding! I can't stand it!
Some day you'll be getting married!</p>

<p>(<span class='sc'>Mr. Bulbus</span> <i>enters in the rear and just stands.</i>)</p>

<p><span class='player'>Jack</span>  (<i>cheerfully</i>). I hope so.</p>

<p><span class='player'>Maude</span>  (<i>arranging train to carry it gracefully</i>).
Poor Mamma!</p>

<p><span class='player'>Mr. De S.</span>  (<i>from outside</i>). Come on! Matilda, bring
Mamma!</p>

<p><span class='player'>Mrs. De S.</span>  O, O, O!</p>

<p><span class='player'>Maude</span>  Brace up, Mamma, you <i>must</i>.</p>

<p><span class='player'>Mrs. De S.</span>  (<i>to her handkerchief</i>). And only yesterday
she was a baby!</p>

<p><span class='player'>Miss H.</span>  (<i>snappishly.</i>) And only day before yesterday
you were!</p>

<p><span class='player'>Mrs. De S.</span>  (<i>from outside</i>). Come on&#8211;we <i>must</i> go.</p>

<p><span class='player'>Chorus</span>  We're coming! (<i>All start, collecting fans,
handkerchiefs, and gathering up trains, adjusting bonnets

<p><span class='player'>Maude</span>  (<i>as they rush for the door</i>). O, look out
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_33'></a>33</span>

<div class='bquote'>
<p>(<i>A Wednesday morning in May, 1905.</i> <span class='sc'>Mr</span>.
<i>and</i> <span class='sc'>Mrs. Jack Hamilton</span> <i>at breakfast. He
reading a paper, totally absorbed. She opening
her letters; there are two by her plate.</i>)</p>
</div> <!-- block quote -->

<p><span class='player'>Maude</span>  (<i>reading letter and talking to herself</i>). Well,
Well! (<i>reading</i>). I am not angry&#8211;not in the least.
You <i>dear</i> old girl! (<i>drops letter and meditates</i>). You
<i>dear</i> old girl! (<i>resumes reading</i>). I know better,&#8211;you
wouldn't! (<i>reads about a page without comment,
then</i>) W-h-y! <i>Why!</i> O goodness gracious! Jack!</p>

<p>(<span class='sc'>Jack</span> <i>looks over top of paper absently, then resumes
reading.</i>)</p>

<p><span class='player'>Maude</span>  (<i>explosively</i>). Jack, what <i>do</i> you think?
Only fancy&#8211;Valeria is&#8211;Jack, listen! Put down your
horrid paper! Valeria is <i>married</i>.</p>

<p>(<i>He looks at her vacantly.</i>)</p>

<p><span class='player'>Jack</span>  Well?</p>

<p><span class='player'>Maude</span>  Well? Listen: Valeria is married.</p>

<p><span class='player'>Jack</span>  (<i>waking to the situation</i>). Is that so! Valeria&#8211;well,
well. I'm not astonished.</p>

<p><span class='player'>Maude</span>  (<i>pensively</i>). Why not?</p>

<p><span class='player'>Jack</span>  (<i>at a venture</i>). O, because&#8211;she is so&#8211;so
handsome.</p>

<p><span class='player'>Maude</span>  (<i>scornfully</i>). She isn't handsome! Where
are your eyes? She's clever&#8211;clever, that's what Valeria
is. But not handsome,&#8211;certainly not. She squints.</p>

<p><span class='player'>Jack</span>  (<i>staring</i>). I thought you were so fond of her.</p>

<p><span class='player'>Maude</span>  (<i>with dignity</i>). I am, I am awfully fond of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_34'></a>34</span>
her&#8211;I've always been. But (<i>cuttingly</i>) affection doesn't
blind <i>me</i>. I can love her and see her faults. Nobody
ever called Valeria handsome.</p>

<p><span class='player'>Jack</span>  (<i>hunting his place on the page</i>). Maybe it was
stunning.</p>

<p><span class='player'>Maude</span>  (<i>with intense emphasis</i>). Stunning!</p>

<p><span class='player'>Jack</span>  (<i>turning the page with a prodigious rattling</i>).
Hal used to rave over her.</p>

<p><span class='player'>Maude</span>  O! Hal, he&#8211;don't rattle your paper so, you
make me nervous! Hal didn't care for her.</p>

<p><span class='player'>Jack</span>  (<i>absently</i>). No, I suppose not, I suppose not.
Of course, nobody could.</p>

<p>(<i>Silence. Both read.</i>)</p>

<p><span class='player'>Maude</span>  (<i>intent on letter and all to herself</i>). I wonder
what she wore! She is too old for white. (<i>reads
aloud</i>). "You'll be surprised, my dear." Yes, I confess
I am. (<i>gazing at coffee urn thoughtfully</i>). Yes, I am.
(<i>resumes reading</i>). Where was I? "I want to tell you
first, dear." Here it is. So she <i>did</i> wear white&#8211;now,
I am astonished. (<i>reads on</i>). For pity sakes! Jack</p>

<p><span class='player'>Jack</span>  (<i>starts violently, crushing paper</i>). A man
might as well live on Vesuvius.</p>

<p><span class='player'>Maude</span>  (<i>in great excitement</i>). But, <i>Jack</i>, guess <i>who</i>
married her.</p>

<p><span class='player'>Jack</span>  (<i>with calm certainty</i>). The man in the Moon.
He's too jolly to mind squints.</p>

<p><span class='player'>Maude</span>  Just guess. You never can.</p>

<p><span class='player'>Jack</span>  (<i>impatiently, much wrought upon.</i>) Then
tell me.</p>

<p><span class='player'>Maude</span>  (<i>in an explosive</i>). Hal!</p>

<p><span class='player'>Jack</span>  (<i>inanely</i>). Hal!</p>

<p><span class='player'>Maude</span>  (<i>calmly, the mine sprung</i>). Hal Taylor.</p>

<p><span class='player'>Jack</span>  Hal Taylor. Well, I am&#8211;bobbed!</p>

<p><span class='player'>Maude</span>  I'm not surprised.</p>

<p><span class='player'>Jack</span>  You said Hal didn't care for her.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_35'></a>35</span><span class='player'>Maude</span>  (<i>very slowly</i>). He doesn't, Jack. Hal was&#8211;<i>roped
in</i>.</p>

<p><span class='player'>Jack</span>  (<i>stares, then gives vent to a long whistle of
astonishment</i>). Well, you women!</p>

<p><span class='player'>Maude</span>  Don't talk to me. I am disgusted!</p>

<p><span class='player'>Jack</span>  (<i>ruefully</i>). Well! (<i>He stares, folds napkin,
unfolds it and takes up his newspaper.</i>)</p>

<p><span class='player'>Maude</span>  Don't sit there, just saying "Well" all the
time!</p>

<p><span class='player'>Jack</span>  (<i>slowly</i>). Say, what is it to you?</p>

<p><span class='player'>Maude</span>  (<i>sobs a little</i>). She h-has deceived me&#8211;basely
deceived me. But I don't care. I shall send her
a cut-glass berry dish,&#8211;maybe a Tiffany c-c-cut! (<i>dries
her eyes resolutely</i>). Coffee, dear?</p>

<p><span class='player'>Jack</span>  (<i>irritably; a trifle suspicious yet</i>). Yes, don't
I <i>always</i> take coffee?</p>

<p><span class='player'>Maude</span>  (<i>plaintively</i>). Don't scold me. I cannot endure
much more. To think Valeria&#8211;</p>

<p><span class='player'>Jack</span>  (<i>with decision, carving the steak</i>). Don't
think, then. Drop it. What's your other letter?</p>

<p><span class='player'>Maude</span>  (<i>sadly</i>). I don't care&#8211;I don't care for anything.
(<i>takes a biscuit</i>). The biscuits are burned.</p>

<p><span class='player'>Jack</span>  No, they are not. Never mind&#8211;give the letter
to me.</p>

<p>(<span class='sc'>Maude</span> <i>gazes pensively at nothing.</i> <span class='sc'>Jack</span> <i>opens the letter
with a fork, and reads silently.</i>)</p>

<p><span class='player'>Jack</span>  (<i>to himself, muttering</i>). Of course, it's
money,&#8211;always money. Only a dollar and fifty cents
apiece,&#8211;a man ought not growl. Umph! "The happy
old days." Yes, I remember.</p>

<p><span class='player'>Maude</span>  (<i>meekly</i>). Remember what, Jack, dear?
(<i>He reads. Silence. She folds and unfolds Valeria's letter.</i>)</p>

<p><span class='player'>Jack</span>  (<i>suddenly</i>). By George!</p>

<p><span class='player'>Maude</span>  (<i>buttering a biscuit, slowly</i>). What is it?</p>

<p><span class='player'>Jack</span>  By George!</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_36'></a>36</span><span class='player'>Maude</span>  What is it? A woman might as well live
on&#8211;on Vesuvius!</p>

<p><span class='player'>Jack</span>  George Graham is in the New York legislature!</p>

<p><span class='player'>Maude</span>  Professor George De Witt Graham!</p>

<p><span class='player'>Jack</span>  (<i>reading while he speaks</i>). The same, my dear.
We're to banquet him; it seems he's made a big speech.</p>

<p><span class='player'>Maude</span>  He was very handsome, and nice to us girls.
He pulled us all through chemistry.</p>

<p><span class='player'>Jack</span>  (<i>absently</i>). Yes, he was a good wire puller.
And now he's Senator, Senator in New York. That's
great.</p>

<p><span class='player'>Maude</span>  How do you know? Is that from him?</p>

<p><span class='player'>Jack</span>  This is the Alumni Letter.</p>

<p><span class='player'>Maude</span>  Alumni?</p>

<p><span class='player'>Jack</span>  (<i>slowly and elaborately</i>). Yes, my dear, the
Alumni Letter,&#8211;Alumni. We graduated in 1902,&#8211;possibly
you remember the circumstances. You ought to.</p>

<p><span class='player'>Maude</span>  How long ago it seems,&#8211;how long, long
ago!</p>

<p><span class='player'>Jack</span>  Thank you. It is. Three years.</p>

<p>(<i>Silence. He stirs coffee.</i>)</p>

<p><span class='player'>Maude</span>  The lace for my dress gave out,&#8211;do you remember?
And I wore Paris muslin and Mamma was
sick.</p>

<p><span class='player'>Jack</span>  It was a great day! You remember your Aunt?</p>

<p><span class='player'>Maude</span>  Poor Aunty! I can see her now&#8211;so 'fraid
I would forget&#8211;sitting on the edge of her chair! And
those lemon drops,&#8211;I thought I should faint when Bob
brought 'em up!</p>

<p><span class='player'>Jack</span>  Yes, I remember how his shoes squeaked! And
Bob <i>would</i> usher!</p>

<p><span class='player'>Maude</span>  Poor Aunty, I hope she is happier now out
among the Hottentots. Aren't they Hottentots?</p>

<p><span class='player'>Jack</span>  (<i>with scholarly precision</i>). Your Aunt, my
dear, is in Korea. Korea is an island just east of&#8211;</p>

<p><span class='player'>Maude</span>  (<i>vaguely</i>). Well aren't the Hottentots there,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_37'></a>37</span>
too? I thought they were all together over there somewhere,&#8211;all
fat and dusty together, with their queer hats
like plates,&#8211;all praying and embroidering lovely silks.</p>

<p><span class='player'>Jack</span>  As I was saying, Korea is east of&#8211;of Asia.</p>

<p><span class='player'>Maude</span>  (<i>taking another biscuit</i>). Asia was always
hard for me. The rivers had such dreadful names!
"1902! 1902! We are the people, who are you?" What
fun we had! Let's go back!</p>

<p><span class='player'>Jack</span>  Haven't time. You write 'em greetings and so
on, and enclose three dollars. I wonder where old
Grindem is?</p>

<p><span class='player'>Maude</span>  Old Grindem! You remember his side whiskers?
I couldn't bear that man! He was horrid on
Commencement day&#8211;wouldn't wait one second! Not
one second! And Valeria, (<i>she sighs heavily</i>). Poor
Valeria!</p>

<p><span class='player'>Jack</span>  (<i>cheerfully</i>). You looked mighty pretty that
day. You didn't need any lace.</p>

<p>(<i>She sighs gently and shakes her head.</i>)</p>

<p><span class='player'>Jack</span>  (<i>with desperate cheerfulness</i>). And your hair
was like gold,&#8211;and those lilies-of-the-valley! I remember
I went so far as to think of Solomon. How is it?
"Solomon in all his glory&#8211;all his glory was&#8211;was&#8211;Solomon
was"&#8211;how is it?</p>

<p><span class='player'>Maude</span>  "Was not arrayed like one of these."</p>

<p><span class='player'>Jack</span>  O yes&#8211;"like one of these," of course. "Solomon
in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these."
You were a sort of female Solomon. Not a Mrs. Solomon,&#8211;perish
the thought!</p>

<p><span class='player'>Maude</span>  (<i>reproachfully</i>). Jack!</p>

<p><span class='player'>Jack</span>  (<i>still cheerfully</i>). Who gave you those lilies?
Come on&#8211;tell me now. This is a sort of anniversary
when "all things shall be made clear." Old Bulbus?</p>

<p>(<i>She braces herself with visible effort.</i>)</p>

<p><span class='player'>Jack</span>  It was awfully hard on me, your just carrying
my roses and putting old Bulbus' lilies in your Solomon
hair.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_38'></a>38</span><span class='player'>Maude</span>  They weren't B-B-Bulbuses.</p>

<p><span class='player'>Jack</span>  Honest?</p>

<p><span class='player'>Maude</span>  H-honest.</p>

<p><span class='player'>Jack</span>  (<i>gravely</i>). Whose were they?</p>

<p>(<i>Silence. Maude twists her napkin.</i>)</p>

<p><span class='player'>Jack</span>  (<i>more gravely</i>). Whose were they, Mrs. Hamilton?</p>

<p><span class='player'>Maude</span>  You won't be mad?</p>

<p><span class='player'>Jack</span>  Do I get "mad"? I am not a two-year-old!</p>

<p><span class='player'>Maude</span>  Nor cross?</p>

<p><span class='player'>Jack</span>  Whose lilies were those, I ask!</p>

<p><span class='player'>Maude</span>  (<i>sitting very erect</i>). I am going to tell you!</p>

<p><span class='player'>Jack</span>  (<i>a trifle viciously</i>). See that you do.</p>

<p><span class='player'>Maude</span>  Hal sent those lilies.</p>

<p><span class='player'>Jack</span>  (<i>incredulous</i>). Hal Taylor?</p>

<p><span class='player'>Maude</span>  (<i>with a dead period</i>). Hal Taylor.</p>

<p>(<i>He gazes at her sternly; she hides her face behind the
coffee urn.</i>)</p>

<p><span class='player'>Jack</span>  <i>Therefore</i>, Valeria squints!</p>

<p><span class='player'>Maude</span>  O <i>don't</i>, Jack!</p>

<p><span class='player'>Jack</span>  (<i>severely</i>). The vanity of woman!</p>

<p><span class='player'>Maude</span>  (<i>rising quickly and coming round to his
chair</i>). But I have your roses, Jack, in the box with
my dress! And I shall send Valeria a cut-glass berry-bowl&#8211;maybe
a Tiffany cut!</p>

<p>(<i>He pulls her down to him as curtain falls.</i>)</p>
